# CarSTAT
The car dataset used in the project was originally taken from the StatLib library maintained at Carnegie  Mellon University. I took the slightly updated version of the dataset. The dataset has details of about 406 cars with characteristics such as MPG, Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, etc. In this project,  we mainly focus on the statistical characteristics of cars based on their origin. Automobile companies in  the US, Japan, and European countries are the major innovators or producers of cars. I was always interested in understanding the focus of an automobile manufacturer. Some may focus to improve the Miles per gallon (MPG) of cars, while others may focus to increase the horsepower of the cars. I want to  understand their interests based on the origin of the manufacturers.
